# DeepLearn Stock Predictor 📈🧠

A Deep Learning-based application that leverages an LSTM model to forecast the closing prices of a stock for the next X days using historical data. It allows users to upload their own datasets, configure model settings, train the model, and visualize both actual and estimated prices through intuitive graphs, performance metrics, and future forecasts for X days.
